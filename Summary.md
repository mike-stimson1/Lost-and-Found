# Australian Government Dataset Scanner - Technical Summary

## Purpose & Problem Statement

The Australian Government publishes hundreds of datasets across multiple agencies, but discovering relevant data for specific research needs is challenging. Users often struggle to:

- Navigate complex data catalogs
- Understand what datasets contain without technical knowledge
- Find datasets that match their specific use case
- Access actual data once they find relevant datasets

## Solution Overview

An AI-powered chat interface that democratizes government data discovery through natural language queries. Users can ask questions like "What housing data is available?" and receive curated dataset recommendations with direct data access.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack

- **React 18 + TypeScript**: Modern, type-safe component architecture
- **Material-UI v5**: Professional, accessible user interface
- **Vite**: Fast development and optimized production builds
- **Axios**: HTTP client for API communication

### Backend Architecture

- **Vercel Serverless Functions**: Secure, scalable API endpoints
- **Node.js + TypeScript**: Server-side logic with type safety
- **OpenAI Assistants API**: Advanced AI reasoning and function calling

### Security Model

- **Server-side API Processing**: API keys never exposed to browser
- **CORS-enabled Endpoints**: Secure cross-origin requests
- **Environment Variable Management**: Encrypted secrets via Vercel

## AI Integration

### OpenAI Assistant Configuration

- **Knowledge Base**: Pre-loaded with Australian government dataset metadata
- **Function Calling**: Structured dataset recommendations via `suggest_datasets` function
- **Natural Language Processing**: Understands user intent and context
- **Relevance Scoring**: AI-powered ranking of dataset suggestions

### Dataset Intelligence

- **Semantic Matching**: Matches user queries to dataset descriptions
- **Multi-agency Coverage**: Spans datasets from ABS, Treasury, Health, etc.
- **Contextual Understanding**: Recognizes related topics and use cases

## Data Integration

### Australian Bureau of Statistics API

- **Real-time Data Access**: Direct integration with official government APIs
- **Dynamic Parameters**: Date ranges, geographic filters, data dimensions
- **Structured Output**: JSON format for easy visualization
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for API limitations

## Key Technical Features

### Conversational Interface

- **Multi-turn Conversations**: Maintains context across queries
- **Follow-up Questions**: Refine searches based on previous results
- **Real-time Responses**: Streaming-like user experience

### Data Visualization

- **Interactive Tables**: Sortable, filterable dataset previews
- **Metadata Display**: Dataset descriptions, update frequencies, sources
- **Download Options**: Access to raw data formats

### Performance Optimizations

- **Serverless Architecture**: Auto-scaling based on demand
- **Client-side Caching**: Reduced API calls for repeated queries
- **Lazy Loading**: Efficient component rendering

## Development Workflow

### Local Development

```bash
vercel dev  # Runs both frontend and serverless functions
```

### Deployment Pipeline

- **Automatic Builds**: Git integration with Vercel
- **Environment Management**: Secure variable injection
- **Zero-downtime Deployments**: Blue-green deployment strategy

## Innovation Highlights

1. **AI-First Discovery**: First government data portal to use conversational AI
2. **Unified Access**: Single interface for multi-agency datasets
3. **Technical Accessibility**: Makes complex data discoverable to non-technical users
4. **Real-time Integration**: Live data access, not just catalogs
5. **Secure Architecture**: Production-ready security model
