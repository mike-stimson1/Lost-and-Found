For a lone person household it is equal to household income. For a household comprising more than one person, it is an indicator of the household income that would be needed by a lone person household to enjoy the same level of economic wellbeing.\n\nAlternatively, equivalised total household income can be viewed as an indicator of the economic resources available to everyone in a household. Mean equivalised household income is therefore calculated by adding the equivalised total household income of all households, and then dividing by the number of people. This enables people in large households to have the same contribution to the mean as people living alone.\n\nEquivalised total household income is set to zero when total household income is negative, such as when losses incurred in a household's unincorporated business or other investments are greater than any positive income from any other sources.\n\nTotal family income is not equivalised. All people in a household benefit from the economies of scale for housing and other shared costs, regardless of whether they are in the same family or not. Therefore the most appropriate indicator of the standard of living of a family is still the equivalised income of the household in which they live.\n\nA more detailed explanation is provided in [Survey of Income and Housing, User Guide, Australia.](https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/6553.0~2013-14~Main%20Features~Income~2)",

Mean equivalised household income is therefore calculated by adding the equivalised total household income of all households, and then dividing by the number of people. This enables people in large households to have the same contribution to the mean as people living alone.\n\nEquivalised total household income is set to zero when total household income is negative, such as when losses incurred in a household's unincorporated business or other investments are greater than any positive income from any other sources.\n\nTotal family income is not equivalised. All people in a household benefit from the economies of scale for housing and other shared costs, regardless of whether they are in the same family or not. Therefore the most appropriate indicator of the standard of living of a family is still the equivalised income of the household in which they live.\n\nA more detailed explanation is provided in [Survey of Income and Housing, User Guide, Australia.](https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/6553.0~2013-14~Main%20Features~Income~2)"

Families are classified in terms of the relationships that exist between a single family reference person and each other member of that family.\n\nReporting relationships in respect of 'Person 1' on the form, can make it difficult to establish all the relationships that exist in a household, or to identify whether more than one family is living in the dwelling. In some cases, additional information such as surname, usual residence and marital status are used during data processing to help determine these relationships."

There are two ancestry variables because Census respondents are able to report up to two ancestries in their response to the question on ancestry.

Ancestry in the Australian context is complex as there are many Australians with origins and heritage that do not, in practice, relate to their current ethnic identity.  When ancestry data is used alone, it should only be done to represent a broad measure of cultural diversity.  Ancestry is particularly useful to identify distinct ethnic or cultural groups within Australia such as Maoris or Australian South Sea Islanders, and groups which are spread across countries such as Kurds. Surrogate measures of ethnicity such as country of birth or languages other than English spoken at home, alone cannot identify these groups. This information is useful in developing policies which reflect the needs of our society and for the effective delivery of services to particular ethnic communities.\n\n##### Ancestry multi response - counting people or responses\n\nWhen [ANCP](https://www.abs.gov.au/census/guide-census-data/census-dictionary/2021/variables-topic/cultural-diversity/ancestry-multi-response-ancp) is added to a table and all the individual ancestries are summed together, a total count of responses, not people, is produced.

For example, a person may have been born in Australia, but they have Papua New Guinean ancestry. This helps us understand our diverse culture.\n\nTo accurately understand ancestry data, both ancestry variables ([ANC1P](https://www.abs.gov.au/census/guide-census-data/census-dictionary/2021/variables-topic/cultural-diversity/ancestry-1st-response-anc1p) and [ANC2P](https://www.abs.gov.au/census/guide-census-data/census-dictionary/2021/variables-topic/cultural-diversity/ancestry-2nd-response-anc2p)) must be used. There are two ancestry variables because Census respondents are able to report up to two ancestries in their response to the question on ancestry. Respondents do not have the option of ranking their answers to the ancestry question, so where a respondent reports two ancestries, they have equal standing. The basis for allocating ancestries to the variables [ANC1P](https://www.abs.gov.au/census/guide-census-data/census-dictionary/2021/variables-topic/cultural-diversity/ancestry-1st-response-anc1p) and [ANC2P](https://www.abs.gov.au/census/guide-census-data/census-dictionary/2021/variables-topic/cultural-diversity/ancestry-2nd-response-anc2p) is based on the order in which they are processed.

Ancestry in the Australian context is complex as there are many Australians with origins and heritage that do not, in practice, relate to their current ethnic identity.  When Ancestry data is used alone, it should only be done to represent a broad measure of cultural diversity.  Ancestry is particularly useful to identify distinct ethnic or cultural groups within Australia such as Maoris or Australian South Sea Islanders, and groups which are spread across countries such as Kurds. Surrogate measures of ethnicity such as country of birth or languages other than English spoken at home, alone cannot identify these groups. This information is useful in developing policies which reflect the needs of our society and for the effective delivery of services to particular ethnic communities.\n\n##### Ancestry multi response -  counting people or responses\n\nWhen ANCP is added to a table and all the individual ancestries are summed together, a total count of responses, not people, is produced. This is because each person can provide up to two ancestries. So the total count of responses for all ancestries in Australia exceeds Australia’s total population. However, when using ANCP to look at individual ancestries, the count of responses is also the count of people. This is because respondents can only state a particular ancestry once (either as [ANC1P](https://www.abs.gov.au/census/guide-census-data/census-dictionary/2021/variables-topic/cultural-diversity/ancestry-1st-response-anc1p) or [ANC2P](https://www.abs.gov.au/census/guide-census-data/census-dictionary/2021/variables-topic/cultural-diversity/ancestry-2nd-response-anc2p)).\n\n##### Measurement issues\n\nThe Ancestry question records all claims of association with ancestries, ethnic origins and cultures.  Whilst some people may respond according to how they may identify with a particular cultural group (subjectively), the intent of the question is to capture the cultural context in which they were raised (objectively).  Multip",

Definitions can differ between different statistical collections and may not match Census definitions.\n\n##### Age and Unpaid child care data\n\nWhen analysing Unpaid child care data, users may notice older respondents who reported they cared for their own child. A small number of this group had their ages imputed, either due to the lack of respondent information or to conform to family processing rules. Imputation rules do not reference Unpaid child care as a factor, so there is no statistical correlation between the fields Age and Unpaid child care for this group.

Definitions can differ between different statistical collections and may not match Census definitions.\n\n##### Age and Unpaid child care data\n\nWhen analysing Unpaid child care data, users may notice older respondents who reported they cared for their own child. A small number of this group had their ages imputed, either due to the lack of respondent information or to conform to family processing rules.

Only if the person walked all the way to work, should ‘Walked only’ be selected.\n\n##### Lockdown\n\nA number of regions across the country were in various stages of lockdown on Census day, and the week preceding it, resulting in a greater number of people working from their homes.  Not only may this impact their responses for their place of work, but also, their travel to work.  Guidance on how to correctly respond was provided at the time on the Census website, as follows:\n\n##### Answering questions about your workplace and job role\n\nIf you are currently working from home due to COVID restrictions, but usually attend a workplace, please write the employer's usual workplace address.\n\n##### Answering questions about whether you had a job\n\nIf you were employed in the 4 weeks prior to the current lockdown period, but haven't been able to work in the last week due to lockdown or requirement to self-isolate, please select 'Yes, but absent on holidays, on paid leave, on strike or temporarily stood down'.\n\n##### Answering questions about your workplace and job role\n\nIf you were employed in the 4 weeks prior to the current lockdown period, but haven't been able to work in the last week due to COVID restrictions or requirement to self-isolate, please answer all questions reflecting your usual occupation.

The sequencing of questions is based on labour force status in the week before Census.\n* If a person rides a bicycle a couple days per week, but ‘usually’ catches the bus, the Method of travel to work focuses on the activity specific to Census day, to capture the minor mode of travel i.e. bicycle.\n\n##### Walked only\n\nIf a person walked some of the way to work and used other methods, it is not included as an additional method. For example, if they walked then caught the bus, then ‘Bus’ only should be selected. Only if the person walked all the way to work, should ‘Walked only’ be selected.\n\n##### Lockdown\n\nA number of regions across the country were in various stages of lockdown on Census day, and the week preceding it, resulting in a greater number of people working from their homes.  Not only may this impact their responses for their place of work, but also, their travel to work.  Guidance on how to correctly respond was provided at the time on the Census website, as follows:\n\n##### Answering questions about your workplace and job role\n\nIf you are currently working from home due to COVID restrictions, but usually attend a workplace, please write the employer's usual workplace address.\n\n##### Answering questions about whether you had a job\n\nIf you were employed in the 4 weeks prior to the current lockdown period, but haven't been able to work in the last week due to lockdown or requirement to self-isolate, please select 'Yes, but absent on holidays, on paid leave, on strike or temporarily stood down'.\n\n##### Answering questions about your workplace and job role\n\nIf you were employed in the 4 weeks prior to the current lockdown period, but haven't been able to work in the last week due to COVID restrictions or requirement to self-isolate, please answer all questions reflecting your usual occupation.
