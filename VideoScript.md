## Intro
The Australian Bureau of Statistics has a lot of data.

It's easy to get lost.

The Lost & Found chatbot acts like a librarian, helping you find the data that you're looking for. 

Our chatbot uses Retrieval Augmented Generation to stay fast and accurate without being drowned out by a sea of data.

Chat with your librarian and see real time suggestions.
